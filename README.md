# iTerm

This is a fork of the original iTerm project (not to be confused with iTerm2 which is still under active development).
The purpose of this fork is to get another terminal emulator option for GNUstep environments. Since this was last developed with OSX 10.4-10.6 in mind and uses pure Cocoa and Objective C in the codebase, this seemed like a viable candidate for use with GNUstep environments.
